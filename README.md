# Max Listeners Exceeded Test

The purpose of this repository is to demonstrate how using `http2` with `serve-static` will reliably
generate **MaxListenersExceededWarning** warnings with as simple a setup as possible.


## Setup
In order to use http2 you must use an *ssl certificte*.  The two files `certificate.pem` and `key.pem` are the certificates generated by me as a certificate authority for the dual domain names `maxtest.dev` and `maxtest.local`.  You will need to set your local dns up  so that one of those two names match the ip address of the machine you run the code on. Alternatively provide your own certificate files.

Once that is completed we need to set up the server npm modules

```
cd server
npm install
```
## running the test

From the root directory of the project, start the server thus:
```
node server/server.js
```

Use your browser to navigate to `https://maxtext.dev:8443`

This should be enough to generate the warnings (once only).  Stop the server with ^C and you can then repeat the tests at will.
